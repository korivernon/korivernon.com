                <b>Computer Science</b> is not the easiest thing to get the hang of.
                At times it can be difficult and you may feel like you hit a
                dead end; however, you deserve to be here (at NYU)! <b>CS-1114</b> is
                designed to give students an Introduction into Computer Science.
                As a Teaching Assistant for <b>CS-1114</b>, it is my goal to make sure
                you are challenged, prepapred, and feel comfortable with the course
                material. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to

                  In this lab we installed IDLE on our computers! Now we're ready
                  to start coding in python3! If you still need a refresher on lab policies, take a look at the

                  presentation.

                 <h2 class="subheading">Lab 10</h2>
                  <p style="max-width: 65vw; text-align:left; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; line-height:24pt;">
                   In lab 10, we discussed lists. Lists are incredibly useful when we want to store and use data repeatedly. Lists are pretty cool
                   because they allow us to store different data types inside of each "bucket." These buckets that are used to store data can be
                   accessed by their indexes, and this is incredibly useful in storing data - this is kind of redundant but if you want to learn
                   more about why lists are so cool, check out this link <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp">hea</a>. <br><br>

                   Lists in python can be defined as <b>Lists, Tuples, Sets, </b>or <b> Dictionaries.</b> <em>However, the only data structures we will
                   be focusing on in this class well be Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries, they are all useful tools in data storage! learn more
                   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp">hea</a> </em>. <br><br>

                   There are two ways we can traditionally traverse a list. One way is to use the syntax:

<pre class="code">
lst = ['one','two','three']
for i in range(len(lst)):
    print(lst[i]) # print list at i</pre>
<b>OR</b>
<pre class="code">
for item in lst:
    print(item) # print the items in the list</pre>

                Tuples, alternatively are immutable lists that we can add data to by creating 'new' tuple'
                and replacing them with the 'old' ones. This is particularly beneficial because of how
                efficient is is to use tuples (but you don't really care about that because you're not in
                Data Structures).
                  </p>

                 <h2 class="subheading">Lab 11</h2>
                  <p style="max-width: 65vw; text-align:left; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; line-height:24pt;">
                   In this lab session we went over how to open and manipulate files using Python. This is an incredibly important skill to master,
                   seeing as it is an integral part of understanding how to manipulate and adapt outside data to use inside of python. <br><br>

                   In order to bring in files, outside .txt or .csv files, you can use the following: <br>

<pre class="code">    file = open([filename],"[w,r,w+]") <br></pre>


                   <em>UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER(better honestly WAYS TO BRING IN FILES, HOWEVER, IN CS-1114, this is what is expected of you ;). </em>

                   <br><br>

                   It is also important to note that in .csv files, the data is separated by commas. In addition to this, the first line generally
                   contains the headings, so you have to "skip" this line when bringing in data. <br>

                   One way to "skip" this line is to use: <br> <pre class="code">    [filename].readline()</pre>

                   In order to bring in the data, you can use a for loop that iterates through every line and brings in the data separated by commas: <br>
<pre class="code">
data_lst = []
for i in [filename]:
    data_lst.append([filename].split(","))</pre>
                   This is kind of difficult to understand, but with time it will get easier to comprehend. <em>Understanding this concept is crucial to
                   applying this to other applications and functions</em>. Take a look at my project that uses similar concepts but with different libraries... (if I forget to link it, bite me).

                In this lab session we went over Object Oriented Programming. For an review of Object Oriented Programming take a look at my
                notes for this Lab: <br>

                <h1 class="heading">Homework Session Review</h1>

                  <h2 class="subheading">Homework Review Session: Dictionaries</h2>
                   <p style="max-width: 65vw; text-align:left; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; line-height:24pt;">
                    Dictionaries are kind-of a difficult concept to wrap your head around, however, once you master them (and you will),
                    they are incredibly useful. One of the coolest uses of dictionaries is that we can store data related to a specific
                    target, we call our <b>key</b>, which in turn gives us our data, we call our <b>value</b>. <br><br>

                    So first let us go over how to instantiate a dictionary. First we need to set our dictionary up. We do that by:
<pre class="code">new_dictionary = {}</pre>
                    After we instantiate our dictionary we now have to add to our dictionary.
<pre class="code">new_dictionary['1'] = 'one'</pre>
                    When we access out new_dictionary, we will get the value one.
<pre class="code">
var = input("Enter an integer: ")
print(new_dictionary[var])</pre>
                    Now let's try something a little more challenging. Let's say we want to continously add to a list inside of a dictionary.
                    What you will find is that inside of a dictionary, we can't use variables in order to add to lists, using the .append(x)
                    how we have done in the past. Instead we are going to have to... <em>get creative</em>. <br><br>

                    What are the ways that we know that we can use to add to a list? We can use list.append(x)... but we can also use
                    list += [x] in order to append to the end of a list. These two will have the same result! Let's give that a try!

<pre class="code">
list_of_names = ['kori','kara','kurt','koal','kia']
list_of_states = ['nc','sc','ny','mo','al','ca','fl']

visited_states_dict = {} # declare your list

for i in range(len(list_of_names)):
    for j in range(len(list_of_states)):
        if i%j == 2 or i%j == 0:
            if len((visited_states_dict[list_of_names[i]])) /
             > 0:
                # if the length is greater than 0
                visited_states_dict[list_of_names[i]] += /
                [list_of_states[j]]
                # add the list_of_states[j] contained
                # in a list to i
            else:
                visited_states_dict[list_of_names[i]] = /
                 [list_of_states[j]]
                # start off the list
            visited_states_dict[list_of_names[i]] = /
            [list_of_states[j]]</pre>

                  This is an incredibly hard concept to grasp, but study the code and try and the the hang of it. It helps tremendously
                  and understanding how this works will help you be successful in Data Structures!
