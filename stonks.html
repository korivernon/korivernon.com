                There is no shortage of internet gurus trying to tell you what you need to do in

                are plenty of people who are peddling get-rich-quick-schemes on YouTube, and the 
                <b>r/wallstreetbets</b> subreddit is filled with thousands of successful and unsuccessful people 
                who become internet legends. The stock market meme culture is something that has really
                taken the internet and mainstream business media by storm.

                What is the stock market?
            </h1>
            <p class="py-3 text-justify">
                The stock market is where investors connect to buy and sell investments-- more commonly
                stocks, which are shares of ownership in a public company. Just like when you need groceries,
                you go to the supermarket, when you want to buy stocks, you can buy them online using a brokerage
                account. The popular platform of choice for Millenials and Generation Z is <a href="https://robinhood.com/"><b>RobinHood</b></a>, an 
                easy to use platform that makes stock market and trading less convoluted than its more involved 
                counterparts. Using this brokerage account you can buy and sell securities (tradable financial assets)
                in the public market of your choice (<a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/investments-you-can-make-on-robinhood/#:~:text=You%20can%20invest%20in%20over,American%20Depositary%20Receipts%20(ADRs).">more information on the investments you can make here</a>)
                
                
                What <b>Robinhood</b> did was revolutionary-- it democratized finance for everyone
                and finally gave everyone who has access to a phone in the United States the ability to enhance
                their financial goals.

                Democratizing Finance.
            </h1>
            <p class="py-3 text-justify">
                Robinhood taking the step to democratize finance is what helps to make finance available to the 
                regular folk. Finance is no longer something that the wealthy one percent and people on "Wall Street" 
                have access to. We now hold the power in the palms of our hands to achieve our financial goals. Finannce is 
                finally "<em>popular</em>." 
                <br><br>
                The word "democratize" is funny in the scope of the United States in the sense that democracy is a 
                synonym to give everyone a say. Although that is exactly what the United State is failing to do through 
                the electoral college system, Robinhood is giving all people the option to pursue their financial goals
                regardless of where they come from, or their connections.

                Where does meme culture come in?
            </h1>
            <p class="py-3 text-justify">
                We first have to define what a meme is <em>(for those of you who do not know and/or have been livinng under a
                    rock)</em>.
            </p>
            <div class="card text-left">
              <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text"><b>meme</b> <em>(noun)</em>: "an element of a culture
                or system or behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic
                means, especially imitation."</p>

            </div>

            <p class="py-3 text-justify">
                Memes have taken the internet and instant message inboxes of Generation Z and Millenials by storm. 
                Meme's are what we use to communicate with one another shared affirmations and disappointments. 
                Chances are that you have more than likely seen a meme within the past week because they're so 
                popular and a part of our lives now. When memes are associated with a subject, 
                there are a specific subset of individuals who care about that trend, and are trying to either popularize or 
                make a mockery out of it. In any subject where there is a strong meme culture, it most definitely 
                exasterbates the popularity of said subject. The stock market and finance are no different.
